				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>For this experiment, we were inspired by our love for One Piece and 
					The Ring of Fire. We're aware that both worlds are not infinite, but 
					we liked the idea of creating islands that contained lava in them. The 
					waves have a moving effect, and the lava colors would shift so it makes it 
					look like its mving as well. 
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?<br></p>
				<p>The p3_worldKeyChanged function employs XXH hashing to derive a deterministic terrain layout from a given key, 
					initializing noise and random seeds accordingly. p3_tileWidth and p3_tileHeight establish a standard tile size 
					of 8x8 pixels, shaping the foundational units of the world. In p3_drawTile, tile appearance is dynamically determined 
					by position and noise value, with distinct thresholds dictating colors and strokes to depict various terrain features. 
					Additionally, a simulated ocean motion effect within p3_drawTile utilizes trigonometric functions to create the illusion 
					of undulating waves, enhancing the immersive quality of the environment.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
	
					The Ring of Fire was a challenge to improve. We needed to understand how to use our Perlin noise code to create infinite islands and a dominant body of water. Also, having a static map felt too dull, so we researched how to create motion on the p5.js website. We stumbled upon the sin() and cos() functions, which create the exact wave effect we were looking for.

				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p>We wanted to recreate a map of the Ring of Fire. To get as close as possible, we added green to form islands and used our version of perlin noise to create island-like structures. We made the map predominantly water and then added a different shade of blue to the islands to imitate shallow water. The grey in the middle represents the volcanoes on the islands. We added color shifting tiles to replicate boiling lava. Finally, we used sinusoidal and cosinusoidal motion to create the wave effect.
