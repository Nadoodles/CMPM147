				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>This experiment allows the user to select one of three images and mutate them into new pictures. The mutation rate can be lowered to slow down the changes in the image.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>initDesign resizes the canvas to a quarter of the inspiration image's dimensions, creating circles at regular intervals, sampling colors, and storing circle data. renderDesign then visualizes this on the canvas by drawing the image and filling circles with their respective colors. mutateDesign introduces variation by randomly adjusting circle positions and sizes within specified constraints, altering the overall appearance of the design.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>Our difficulties stemmed from struggling to understand the project at first. The guidelines for this experiment were loose, so it was hard for us to conceive an idea that would get us a passing grade. Once we decided on a direction, our result was much more manageable. The example project overlaid a series of translucent rectangles over the original image. Our take was to keep the original image and then use its pixels to give each of our ellipses a color similar to the original. It was hard to tell the difference between each image if they were all grayscale, so keeping the original color palette was our goal.
