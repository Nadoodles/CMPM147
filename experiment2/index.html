				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment involves creating a dynamic landscape using procedural generation techniques. By generating mountains and a sun that move and change color over time, we're aiming to simulate a natural and visually appealing scene. Additionally, the inclusion of various colors and shapes adds an aesthetic dimension to the experiment.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The draw() function is continuously called in a loop to update the canvas. It starts by drawing the background gradient using the drawBackground() function, which takes the top and bottom colors as arguments. The time variable is incremented within the draw() function to simulate the passage of time. Next, the sun's position and color are updated using its update() method, and then it's drawn on the canvas with the draw() method. For each mountain range in the array, its update() method is invoked to update its properties based on time, and then it's drawn on the canvas using the draw() method. Additionally, there are helper functions like drawBackground() for creating the gradient background and classes like Sun and MountainRange to represent the sun and mountain objects, respectively. The Sun class manages properties such as base color, position, and speed, while the MountainRange class handles properties such as color, position, and movement to create a dynamic and visually appealing landscape scene.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this assignment, I referenced my code from a p5.js project. I shared it in the google docs. I also use chat gpt. Other than that, i worked on this assignment on my own. </p>
